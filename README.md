This is desktop application based on WinForm,
it contains Authentication that relies on your local Database. It is compressed to .exe file which not contains viruses just to be clear. The UI of the application is pretty rough but the beauty of the application is the logic behind it. It was a lot fun to code it and i gain a lot of experience from the process.



Tips: If you close the application make sure it is not running on Task Manager :D
